# MARLIN
This repository hosts MARLIN, an advanced provenance detection system that combines GraphAlignment-based and Anomaly path mining-based techniques for real-time threat detection.

MARLIN uses a tag propagation-based framework to perform efficient detection across complex network environments. By leveraging graph theory and machine learning algorithms, it can identify suspicious patterns and potential security breaches with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

We continuously develop and enhance MARLIN's capabilities to address evolving cybersecurity challenges in enterprise environments.‚ò∫Ô∏è

## üéâ Introduction

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12541"><img src="images/First_page.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" align="right" width="160"/></a></p>

- Introduces MARLIN, an advanced provenance detection system that conceptualizes attack detection as a streaming graph alignment problem, combining GraphAlignment-based and Anomaly path mining-based techniques.

- Implements a tag propagation-based framework that efficiently processes streaming provenance graphs with minimal computational overhead, analyzing each event only once without needing to cache entire graphs.

- Utilizes query graphs with seeds and fuzzified matching conditions to detect both standard and mutated attack patterns, making it robust against evasion tactics like benign event insertion.

## System Overview

</p>

Marlin's architecture comprises three main components:
- `Flink Stream Computing Framework`: Pulls streaming log data from Kafka and transforms it into event triplets.
- `Query Graph Construction`: Builds corresponding query graphs by collecting attack reports from Drapa and incorporating TTPs constructed from MITRE ATT&CK.
- `Tag-based Graph Alignment`: Uses a four-stage tag process to align graph states, and employs a secondary indexing mechanism to update and preserve these states.

## Run MRALIN
We show how to run MARLIN in this section.
Firstly, please clone this repo first:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarineYY/MARLIN.git && cd src/main
